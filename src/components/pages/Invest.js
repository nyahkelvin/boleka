                            As a Boleka investor, we allow you to set your own terms; you can tailor your lending to suit you. You are allowed to spread your money across a number of profiles/borrowers â€“ this is proven to be a risk minimiser. You can fund a loan in full or as a
                            percentage, whichever way that suits you. Lending starts from as little as R500.00. It's as simple as the following 3 steps.

                        <div className="description">
                            Choose a rate and risk level which Boleka provides for each borrower. You set your rates dependent on the level of risk you're comfortable with. There are different risk levels 0 to 5. You can then choose to lend for a shorter period (1-12 Months) or
                            a longer period (1-3 years).

                            We match your lending offers to loan requests from borrowers. You can see how much you've lent, who's borrowed from you and how much is still available when you sign into your account. You will receive repayments and interest each month which you can
                            withdraw or lend out again.
